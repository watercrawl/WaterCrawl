    "### üöÄ Objective-Driven Web Crawling with WaterCrawl, LiteLLM, and Rank-BM25\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this **step-by-step Jupyter Notebook** where we explore goal-oriented web crawling. This tutorial will guide you through using WaterCrawl to search and scrape web content, filter URLs with Rank-BM25 and LLMs, and analyze data to meet a specific objective for a company or website.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What‚Äôs inside?\n",
    "| üîß Component | üí° Why we‚Äôre using it |\n",
    "|--------------|----------------------|\n",
    "| **WaterCrawl** | For searching the web and scraping content with precision. |\n",
    "| **LiteLLM** | To interact with various LLM providers for strategy generation, ranking, and content analysis. |\n",
    "| **Rank-BM25** | For efficient keyword-based URL filtering and ranking. |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notebook Flow üó∫Ô∏è\n",
    "1. **Setup**: Install dependencies and configure API keys.\n",
    "2. **Initialization**: Set up the target company or URL and objective.\n",
    "3. **Search Strategy Generation**: Use an LLM to create search strategies.\n",
    "4. **Web Search**: Perform a search with WaterCrawl to gather URLs.\n",
    "5. **URL Filtering**: Apply Rank-BM25 and LLM-based filtering to select relevant URLs.\n",
    "6. **Content Scraping**: Scrape content from top URLs using WaterCrawl.\n",
    "7. **Content Analysis**: Analyze scraped content with LLMs to meet the objective.\n",
    "8. **Results**: Compile and display the final structured response.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why you‚Äôll ‚ù§Ô∏è this approach\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Quickly process vast web data.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Switch between LLM providers for different tasks.\n",
    "- **Precision**: Combine keyword and semantic analysis for accurate results.\n",
    "- **Customizability**: Tailor search depth, language, and model selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip:** If you‚Äôre new to WaterCrawl, check out the [WaterCrawl Documentation](https://docs.watercrawl.dev/intro) for more details.\n",

    "## Customizing Your Web Crawling Experience: Key Configuration Options\n",
    "\n",
    "When using an objective-driven web crawling tool, you can fine-tune various settings to optimize how it searches, evaluates, and interprets information. Each setting comes with **default values** defined in a configuration file ([config.py](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/armof/projcects/langchain/watercrawl-tutorials/URL%20and%20objective%20%28Map,%20filter,%20and%20scrape%29/objective_crawler/config.py:0:0-0:0)), which are used automatically if you don‚Äôt specify custom values. As a user, you have the flexibility to stick with these defaults for simplicity or override them with new values to tailor the tool to your specific needs. Below, I‚Äôll break down each configuration option in simple terms, highlighting the defaults and the custom settings shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SEARCH_LLM (Default: \"o4-mini\", Custom: \"deepseek/deepseek-chat\")**  \n",
    "  This setting chooses the language model that generates search queries to find relevant information. Imagine it as the creative mind brainstorming the best search terms for your goal. The default is set to \"o4-mini\" in the config, but here it‚Äôs customized to DeepSeek's chat model, which excels at crafting diverse and targeted search ideas to kickstart the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RANKING_LLM (Default: \"o4-mini\", Custom: \"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514\")**  \n",
    "  After gathering potential web pages, this model ranks them based on how likely they are to contain useful content. Think of it as a discerning judge prioritizing the most relevant search results. The default is \"o4-mini,\" but it‚Äôs overridden here to Anthropic's Claude Sonnet (version 4-20250514), a powerful choice for accurate and nuanced ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CONTENT_ANALYSIS_LLM (Default: \"o4-mini\", Custom: \"gpt-4.1-mini\")**  \n",
    "  Once web pages are scraped, this model dives into the content, extracting key details tied to your objective. Picture it as a meticulous researcher summarizing critical insights from each page. By default, it uses \"o4-mini,\" but this example sets it to OpenAI's GPT-4.1 Mini, offering a balance of efficiency and depth for analyzing text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **REASONING_LLM (Default: \"o4-mini\", Custom: \"o3\")**  \n",
    "  This is the final brain that compiles all the analyzed data into a coherent answer or summary for your objective. It‚Äôs like the writer of your final report, weaving together insights from multiple sources. The config defaults to \"o4-mini,\" but it‚Äôs changed here to \"o3,\" likely referring to an OpenAI model (possibly a variant or placeholder), chosen for its strong synthesis and reasoning capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TOP_K (Default: 5, Custom: \"4\")**  \n",
    "  This number decides how many top-ranked web pages will be deeply analyzed. It‚Äôs akin to selecting the top articles to study closely from a broader list. The default in the config is 5, but setting it to 4, as shown, ensures a focused analysis on a slightly smaller, high-quality set of sources, balancing depth with efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **STRATEGIES (Default: 3, Custom: \"3\")**  \n",
    "  This determines how many different search approaches or query variations the tool will use to find relevant pages. Think of it as asking different experts to search in their unique styles. The default is 3 in the config, and this example keeps it at 3, striking a balance by providing variety in search methods without overwhelming the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SEARCH_DEPTH (Default: \"basic\", Custom: \"basic\")**  \n",
    "  This controls the intensity of the web search‚Äîhow deep the tool digs into the internet. It‚Äôs like choosing between a quick skim or an exhaustive dive. The default is \"basic\" in the config, and it‚Äôs left as \"basic\" here, opting for a faster, less intensive search, ideal for straightforward goals, saving time and resources while still delivering results.\n",
    "\n",
    "By tweaking these settings, you can tailor the web crawling tool to match your specific needs‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre aiming for speed, precision, or comprehensive coverage. You can rely on the defaults from the configuration file for a ready-to-go setup or set custom values, as shown in this example, to experiment and optimize the journey from raw web data to actionable insights!"

Profitability remains positive with ~6‚Äì7 % net margin and healthy cash reserves, but sales headwinds and regulatory changes have led to cautious analyst sentiment and a modest downside consensus target (~$277‚Äì306). Key upcoming catalyst is the Q2 2025 earnings report on July 23, 2025.\u001b[0m\n",
