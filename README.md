> 
> # Also update these URLs accordingly
> MINIO_BROWSER_REDIRECT_URL=http://your-domain.com/minio-console/
> MINIO_SERVER_URL=http://your-domain.com/
> ```
> Failure to update these settings will result in broken file uploads and downloads. For more details, see [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md).

> **Important:** Before deploying to production, ensure that you update the `.env` file with the appropriate configuration values.
